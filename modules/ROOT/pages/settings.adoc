== Introduction

This document describes which settings are available and how to set them

== Settings Screen

To manage the settings in ownCloud's iOS App for iPhone and iPad, click btn:[Settings] in the bottom right-hand corner of the Accounts List view.

== Security

=== Passcode 

To protect access to the iOS app with a Passcode, enable btn:[Passcode Lock] in the Settingâ€™s Security section. You will then be prompted to enter, and repeat, a 4-digit Passcode.
If a Passcode was set, the file provider extension in Files.app or in other third party apps will be locked too. The file provider presents a UI to unlock the Passcode.

=== Lock Delay

When a Passcode is enabled, the app will be locked every time you change to another application. However, under menu:Settings[Security > Lock application], you can choose to only lock the application after 1, 5, or 30 minutes, instead of "_immediately_", which is the default.

=== Biometrical Lock

After a Passcode has been created, a Biometrical Lock, or Touch ID, can also be used to gain access to the app. To enable it enable btn:[Touch ID] in the Setting's _Security_ section, and then enter your 4-digit Passcode. The next time you need to authorise access to the app, you will be able to enter either your Passcode, or use your stored biometrical data.

To view previously approved certificates, navigate to
menu:Settings[Certificates] (for any one of your registered accounts), and you will see them listed in the "_User-Approved Certificates_" section.

=== System Appearance (up from iOS 13)

When System Appearance is selected, ownCloud will automatically use the selected iOS system theme (light or dark) to reflect the system UI. Setting System Appearance is only available up from iOS 13.

== Logging

The ownCloud iOS app has built-in logging functionality, available under menu:Settings[Logging]. To find out more, please refer to the
xref:troubleshooting.adoc#capturing-app-debug-logs[logging section of the Troubleshooting guide].

== Media Upload (Conversion)

When image and video files are uploaded, they can be converted to the industry-standard JPEG and MP4 respectively. This is not done by default.
