== Introduction

The IOS app provides a number of features designed to make managing files as simple as possible.

== Features

* File list filter
* File sort options
* Thumbnails for supported images
* File quota (only displayed in the root folder)
* File actions
* Folder actions
* Select all/none

Click on a file to view it and click on a folder to view its contents. To view further actions available for a file or folder, click the _More_ icon on the far right-hand side.

== File Actions

The actions available for files are: 

* Open in
* Move
* Rename
* Duplicate
* Copy
* Delete
* Make Available Offline

However, file actions are handled slightly differently, depending on whether one or multiple files have been selected. You can see the differences in the two images below.

|===
| *Individual File Actions*
| *Multiple-Selected File Actions*

| File popup for actions for _individual_ files
| Move icon row for _multiple-selected_ files

== Navigate Folders

There are two ways to navigate folders (outside of the root folder). To go back to the parent folder, tap btn:[Back] in the top left-hand corner. To navigate directly to *any* parent folder, tap on the current folder's name. When you do, you will see the names of all the parent folders, right up to the root folder, as in the image below.

image:files/21_File_list_parent.png[Navigating folders in ownCloud's iOS app, width=35%,pdfwidth=35%]

== Navigate Files

When navigating files, as you would expect, you can scroll up and down the files and folders list. In addition, you can also use the index bar, highlighted in the screenshot below, to speed up traversing through files and folders. As you slide your finger over each letter, youâ€™ll jump to the first file (or folder) that begins with that letter.

NOTE: The index bar is only visible, if the sort order is `Name`.

image:files/index-bar-with-callout.png[Navigating files in ownCloud's iOS app, width=40%,pdfwidth=40%]

== Sort Files and Folders

By default, files and folders are sorted by name in ascending order, with folders sorted before files. However, files can be sorted in ascending and descending order by name, type, size, date, and shared. If you press the Sort by menu, you can change sort method and order. The first time you change the sort category, files and folders are sorted using that category in ascending order. If you choose that category a second time, the sort order is inverted.

== View Files

To view a file, tap on its name in the file list. Any file type
{ios-safari-supported-filetypes-url}[supported by iOS Safari] can be displayed in the app. Depending on the file type, the image will be able to viewed, or an icon for it, along with some file details, will be displayed.

[NOTE]
====
If the file is not available locally on the device, you will see
image:files/icon-not-available-locally.png[alt=A file is not downloaded locally on the ownCloud iOS app, width=4%,pdfwidth=4%]
next to the file.

When you click on it, you will see

next to it while it downloads.

=== Video Files

Video files have the standard iOS video controls available, which include play, pause, AirPlay, volume, skip forward, skip back, close, and full screen.

== Folder Actions

When working with folders, click the plus icon near the top right-hand corner, and three actions become available; these are:

* xref:create-folder[Create folder]
* xref:upload-files[Upload files]
* xref:upload-file-from-your-photo-library[Upload file from your photo library]
* xref:make-available-offline[Make available offline]

=== Create Folder

To create a new folder, click btn:[Create folder], enter the name of the new folder, as in the image below, and click btn:[return].

image:files/create-new-folder.png[How to create a new folder in ownCloud's iOS App., width=35%,pdfwidth=35%]

=== Upload Files

To upload files or any time from your device to your ownCloud server, click btn:[Upload file]. You will then be able to select or browse through files from any app that exposes data to the iOS files app.

=== Make Available Offline

Please see the xref:available_offline.adoc[Offline Storage section].

==== Upload File From Your Photo Library

To upload photos from your photo library, you first need to allow the iOS app access to your photos. After that, you can browse through your photos, as you normally would. You can then select one or more photos by pressing them, or click btn:[Select All] in the bottom left-hand corner to select all photos in the current folder. When you're happy with your photo selection, click btn:[Upload] and the photo(s) will be uploaded.

=== Move Files and Folders

Whether you are using the iPhone or iPad version of the ownCloud app, you can select and drag and drop one or more files and folders from one folder to another. To do so, you first press btn:[Select] in the top right-hand corner and select one or more files and/or folders. Then, you press and hold on any of the selected files and folders and:

* Drag and drop them over a folder in the current directory
* Drag and drop them over the "*Move to*" icon (or tap the icon), near the bottom left-hand side of the screen. You then navigate to the folder that you want to move them to and click btn:[Move here] at the bottom of the screen.

[NOTE] 
====
If a file or folder with the same name as one or more of those being moved, already exists in the destination directory, you will see a warning that the file or folder could not be moved.

====

== Drag & Drop Files Between Apps (iPad-only)

The iOS app supports the multitasking features on iPad. If you open it as a second app with Slide Over, you can use two apps at the same time with Split View and drag and drop one or more files between the two apps. Refer to Apple's
{multitasking-on-ipad-url}[Multitasking On Your iPad guide] for more information.
