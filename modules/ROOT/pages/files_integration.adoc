== Share From Other Apps (via iOS Files App)

When the iOS app is installed and at least one account is properly configured, files on your iOS device can be shared with your ownCloud server. To do so, first enable the location from the Locations list (step through how to do this). After that, when sharing a file, first click btn:[Save to Files], choose a location to store the file, and click btn:[Add]. These steps are shown in the three images below.
