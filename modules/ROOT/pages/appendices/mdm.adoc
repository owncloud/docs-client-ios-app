== Introduction

Starting with iOS 7, Apple added support for {mdm-protocol-ref-url}[managed application configuration]. An MDM server can push a configuration to the iOS App. The app can access this configuration (read-only) using the `NSUserDefaults` class by reading a configuration dictionary under the key _com.apple.configuration.managed_. An app can also observe a system notification (_NSUserDefaultsDidChangeNotification_) to get notified about configuration changes. In addition feedback can be queried back by MDM server. To enable that, app has to write a dictionary with feedback information into user defaults under _com.apple.feedback.managed_ key. The configuration is basically a key-value dictionary provided as a `.plist` file.

== Configurable Settings

ownCloud App implements a mechanism internally called Class Settings which can be derived from different sources:

- Environment variables which e.g. can be set in Xcode for testing. In this case setting keys have to   be prepended with _oc:_ prefix.
- User preferences accessed by the very same API but stored under _org.owncloud.user-settings_ key.
- Settings dictionary pushed by an MDM Server and accessible using `NSUserDefaults` API under the key   _com.apple.configuration.managed_.
- Default settings defined directly in the app sourcecode.
- Branding.plist which is the part of the Xcode project under ownCloud/Resources/Theming. It allows to   override class settings by specifying them in the `Configuration` section

This is also an order in which these settings take precedence (environment variables have highest priority). So, when settings are accessed, they are merged and higher priority value for the same key overwrites lower priority ones.

Some settings are accessed only once at runtime and the read value is cached, so that new setting to take effect may a require an app to be terminated and restarted.

=== App Basic Configurations

There are few settings allowing to mark an app installation as BETA and e.g. to supress UIKit animation and review prompt.

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=app]

=== Extensions / Actions

ownCloud app uses internally a plug-in like mechanism called extensions. Extensions are used to implement menu actions mostly found under "+" menu allowing to add new items (Upload media, take photo etc.) or in more menu (Copy, Move, Open in etc.). Using below settings actions / extensions can be disabled. Extensions are enabled by default, however this might depend on licensing requirements of a particular extension.

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=actions]

(*) These extensions might require additional license (in-app purchase, enterprise version).

=== Display Settings

To customize file list UI behevior, following settings are available: 

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=displaysettings]

=== Passcode Enforcement

If your organization policies require users to use a passcode as an additional security barrier for managed apps, the below setting will allow to enforce this requirement.

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=passcode]

=== Bookmark

Below settings allow to configure the app to use a certain server URL and even bind it to this URL only by setting the default non-editable.

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=bookmarks]

=== Item Policies

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=policies]

=== Connection

Settings concerning HTTP user agent, cookies, background support etc.

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=connection]

==== Server Endpoints

Individually configurable endpoints of the ownCloud server instance.

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=endpoints]

==== Connection Authentication / Security

Settings concerning certificate validation policies.

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=security]

==== OAuth2 Based Authentication

Settings allowing to configure OAuth2 based authentication.

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=oauth2]

==== OpenID Connect (OIDC) parameters

OpenID Connect (OIDC) parameters allow you fine-tune the behaviour, in case the Identity Provider (IdP) needs something special.

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=oidc]

=== Logging

Logging settings control the ammount and type of app internal log messages stored as text files and accessible via settings menu.

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=logging]

=== Account Handling

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=account]

=== Authentication Settings

Authentication settings control the behaviour of the web-based login.

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=authentication]

=== Browsersession (deprecated)

Browsersession settings were extended, and are now included in `authentication.browser-session-class` (Authentication Settings)

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=browsersession]

=== Branding Parameters

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=branding]

===  Build Options

The following build options are only available for configuring custom builds via the `Branding.plist` file. They can't be configured dynamically wih MDM: 

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=build]

=== Diagnostics

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=diagnostics]

=== Licensing

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus orci lorem, sagittis at mollis non, consequat a purus. Integer vestibulum luctus est id faucibus. Etiam euismod posuere tristique.

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=licensing]

=== Localization feature

The localization feature allows to overwrite every string in the app, in every language.

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=localization]

=== Releasenotes

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=releasenotes]

////
=== Shortcuts

Shortcuts are a very powerful way to build automated workflows in iOS. Apps can provide shortcut intents
for certain actions. ownCloud app provides certain actions as shortcuts as well (e.g. allowing to get
account information, create folder and so on). However in some cases it might make sense to disable
shortcuts to minimize security risks. It can be done using following option:

include::{mdm-base-url}{mdm-tag-name}{mdm-file-url}[tag=shortcuts]

== AppConfig XML Schema

{appconfig-xml-format-url}[The XML format], developed by AppConfig community, makes it easy for developers to define and deploy an app configuration. It not only supports configuration variables having default values, but also provides a configuration UI description, which can be interpreted by the tool and which generates a plist file. Moreover, specfile XML is consistently supported by major EMM vendors.

AppConfig conformant spec file tailored to administrator needs and containing one or more of the above settings can be easily created using {appconfig-url}/www/appconfigspeccreator/[Config Spec Creator] tool hosted at {appconfig-url}[AppConfig website].

== Example: Deployment With MobileIron

1. Open {appconfig-jam-url}[AppConfig Generator]
2. Upload a specfile.xml.
3. Change the configuration options.
4. Download the generated plist file (ManagedAppConfig).
5. Open MobileIron Core.
6. Navigate to menu:Policies and Configs[Add New > Apple > iOS/tvOS > Managed App Config]
7. Upload the generated plist and specify name, bundle ID, and description

== Example: Deployment With Jamf Pro

1. Open {appconfig-jam-url}[AppConfig Generator]
2. Upload a specfile.xml.
3. Change the configuration options.
4. Copy Dictionary (button).
5. Open Jamf Pro.
6. Navigate to menu:Devices[Mobile Device Apps > ownCloud - File Sync and Share > iOS/tvOS > App Configuration > Edit]
7. Paste the generated Dictionary into the "Preferences" field.
