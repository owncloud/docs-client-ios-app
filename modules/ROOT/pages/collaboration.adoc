The Mobile App for iOS supports the following collaboration functionality:

* Adding users and grant permissions
* Adding groups and grant permissions
* Changing permissions
* Deleting collaborators

== Grant Access With Links

Just as with the web interface, the iOS app lets you grant access to both files and folders with links.
Specifically, you can do the following:

* xref:copy-private-links[Copy private links]
* xref:create-public-links[Create public links]
* xref:set-passwords-and-expiration-dates[Set passwords and expiration dates]
* xref:send-public-link-urls-to-other-apps[Send public link URLs to other apps (mail, messenger)]
* xref:delete-public-links[Delete public links]

=== Copy Private Links

To copy a private link to a file or folder, click the more icon on the far right-hand side of the file, and then click btn:[Links]. As in the example below, you will then see the private link to the file. Clicking btn:[copy] on the far right-hand side will copy the link to the iOS clipboard.

=== Create Public Links

To create public links to a file or folder, click the more icon on the far right-hand side of the file, and then click btn:[Links]. Then, under Public Links, click btn:[Create Public Link] in the Public Links section. You will then see the links for the option, as in the image below.

As with the web interface, you can set:

* A link name
* Link permissions
* xref:set-passwords-and-expiration-dates[A link password and expiration date]
